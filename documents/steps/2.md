## Step 2: Store MP3 Files on App

1. **Create File Chooser:**
   - Implement a file chooser dialog using JavaFX's `FileChooser` to allow users to select MP3 files.

2. **Handle File Selection:**
   - Set up an event listener to capture the user's file selection when they choose MP3 files through the file chooser.

3. **Store File Paths:**
   - Create a data structure (e.g., a list or database) to store the file paths of the selected MP3 files.

4. **Check for Duplicate Entries:**
   - Before adding a file path to the list, check if it already exists to avoid duplicate entries in your music library.

5. **Persist Data:**
   - Implement a mechanism to persistently store the file paths, so the information is retained even when the application is closed and reopened. This could involve serialization, a simple database, or storing paths in a configuration file.

6. **Update UI on File Addition:**
   - After adding a new MP3 file, update the UI to visually confirm the addition in the list of songs.

7. **Handle Cancel Action:**
   - Implement functionality to handle the user canceling the file chooser dialog without selecting any files. Provide appropriate feedback or take necessary actions.

8. **Validate File Format:**
   - Check that the selected files are in the MP3 format. You can use file extensions or library functions to verify the file format.

9. **Extract Initial Metadata:**
   - Extract basic metadata (such as file name, duration, etc.) from the selected MP3 files. This information can be displayed in the UI.

10. **Handle Large Music Libraries:**
    - Consider optimizations or background processing if users have large music libraries. You may want to avoid freezing the UI while processing files.

11. **Handle Errors Gracefully:**
    - Implement error handling to deal with cases where selected files are not accessible, corrupted, or not in the expected MP3 format.

12. **Testing:**
    - Test the file selection and storage process thoroughly with various scenarios, including different file formats, large file collections, and edge cases.
